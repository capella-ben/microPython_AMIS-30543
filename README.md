# microPython_AMIS-30543

This is a simple port of the arduino library:  https://github.com/pololu/amis-30543-arduino to microPython for the Pololu AMIS-30543 stepper motor driver: https://www.pololu.com/product/2970.

I have tested this on the Raspberry Pi Pico only.

This library also includes functions to move a motor with and without acceleration.
